I use two kinds of _12x24inch_ acrylic sheets, one as “thin”, 1/8 inch thick, another as “thick”, 1/4inch. Need to cut all three files for one chamber. The bottom file contains two bottoms, but only one is needed for one chamber. Other two “thin” files for one chamber only. So for one bottom file, you can print two copies of 'thin_1' and 'thin_2' files.
